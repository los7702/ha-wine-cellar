### AI-Powered Wine Intelligence
- **One-Scan Label Recognition** — Snap a photo of a wine label and Google Gemini identifies the wine and provides a full sommelier assessment in one call: name, winery, vintage, type, region, grape variety, disposition, drink window, tasting description, estimated price, and critic rating estimates (Wine Spectator, Robert Parker, James Dunnuck, Antonio Galloni)
- **AI Batch Scan** — One-click full AI analysis on your entire cellar: disposition, drink windows, descriptions, pricing, and ratings for every bottle
- **Wine List / Receipt Scanner** — Photograph a restaurant wine list or store receipt and get every wine extracted with AI-powered analysis in a single call: critic scores, disposition, drink window, description, retail price estimates, and markup percentages. Highlights best-value picks and lets you add any wine to your cellar or buy list with one tap. Shows "IN CELLAR" badge and your personal score when a scanned wine matches one already in your collection. Optionally enrich with Vivino ratings and images. Supports long lists (up to 3 minute timeout).
- **Gemini Price Fallback** — When Vivino has no pricing data, Gemini AI provides estimated retail prices as a fallback for single wine refresh and batch scans
- **Auto-Enrich on Add** — When you add a wine, Vivino data (rating, price, description, food pairings) is automatically fetched in the background

### Vivino Integration
- **Cellar Sync** — Connect your Vivino cellar by pasting your cellar URL and session cookie once (see **[docs/vivino-import.md](docs/vivino-import.md)**). One-tap 🔄 Vivino Sync then imports every bottle you own (with ratings, images, region, grape data, and your personal star ratings/notes) as unassigned wines. Bottle counts are respected and already-imported bottles are never duplicated.
- **Auto Sync** — Optionally sync the cellar automatically twice a day. When the session cookie expires, a notification prompts you to paste a fresh one.
- **Sync Service & Sensor** — `wine_cellar.sync_vivino` service for automations plus a `Cork Dork Vivino Cellar` sensor reporting the last sync
- **Vivino Batch Scan** — Refresh all wines from Vivino in one click: ratings, review counts, market pricing, descriptions, food pairings, alcohol content, and grape variety. Falls back to Gemini AI pricing when Vivino has no price.
- **Individual Vivino Refresh** — Update any single wine's Vivino data from the detail dialog
- **Wine Search** — Search Vivino by name to find and add wines without a barcode
- **Wine List Vivino Enrichment** — After scanning a wine list, optionally click "Get Vivino Scores" to add Vivino ratings and images to your results

### Scanning & Input
- **Camera Barcode Scanning** — Point your phone or tablet camera at a barcode to auto-lookup details from Vivino and Open Food Facts
- **AI Label Scanning** — Photo-based label recognition with full wine analysis
- **Manual Entry** — Add wines by hand with a comprehensive form

### Ratings & Notes
- **Interactive Half-Star Rating** — Rate wines from 0.5 to 5.0 stars
- **Structured Tasting Notes** — Record aroma, taste, finish, and overall impression
- **AI Critic Estimates** — Gemini provides estimated scores from Wine Spectator, Robert Parker, James Dunnuck, and Antonio Galloni
- **Vivino Community Ratings** — Real ratings and review counts from Vivino's user base

### Home Assistant Integration
- **HA Sensors** — Entities for total bottles, capacity percentage, and per-cabinet counts for use in automations and dashboards
- **Services** — Automate adding, removing, and moving wines via HA services

4. Search for **Cork Dork** and click **Install**
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/wine_cellar` folder into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Setup

1. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration**
2. Search for **Cork Dork** and follow the setup flow

```

### AI Features (Optional)

To enable label recognition, AI analysis, wine list scanning, and batch AI scanning:

1. Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Cork Dork > Configure**
3. Enter your Gemini API key
4. Features unlocked:
   - **Recognize Label** button in the Add Wine dialog (camera to full analysis in one scan)
   - **AI** button on individual wines (full analysis with disposition, ratings, pricing)
   - **AI Batch Scan** button in the card header (analyze all wines at once)
   - **Scan List** button to photograph wine lists and receipts for instant analysis
   - **Gemini price fallback** when Vivino has no pricing data

### Connecting Your Vivino Cellar

Vivino has no public read API for your own cellar — the site uses a Rails
session cookie and serves the cellar from an Inertia.js endpoint on
`www.vivino.com` (not the `api.vivino.com` mobile backend). Cork Dork reads it
by replaying a session cookie you paste from your browser.

- **[docs/vivino-import.md](docs/vivino-import.md)** has full instructions for
  both methods:
  - **Integration sync (recommended):** paste your cellar URL and session cookie
    in **Cork Dork → Configure**, then use **🔄 Vivino Sync** (or enable twice-daily
    auto-sync). When the cookie expires, a notification prompts you to refresh it.
  - **One-time CSV export:** run a browser-console snippet and load the file via
    **📦 Inventory → Import CSV**.
- After importing, **🍇 Vivino Batch Scan** enriches wines with ratings, pricing,
  descriptions, and images from Vivino's public data.

## Default Cabinet Layout

The integration ships with 3 cabinet sections, each with 10 rows and 9 columns (90 slots per section, 270 total). The bottom row of each section defaults to a bulk bin storage zone. Rack dimensions (up to 20×20), names, depth (1-6 bottles deep), and per-row storage types (Slots, Bulk Bin, Wine Box) can all be customized through the **Manage Racks** button in the tab bar.
